I3E Assignment 1 

Virtual world that utilises Unity functions - scripts + world building
The game can be run on desktop(Windows (PC), macOS, Linux, and Universal Windows Platform (UWP)), mobile(Android, iOS, and tvOS) and consoles(PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and Game Core for Xbox)


How is the game played?
The user starts out in a facility
The user has to collect 5 coins in order to open the main door and leave the facility
Some coins are guarded by hazards that are can be avoided/disabled so that the player can attain all coins
Keycards may be required to unlock certain doors


Controls
Users can use WASD to walk and spacebar to jump
To collect items, users just need to walk into the item
To unlock doors, users just need to walk into it


Game steps
The user starts in a room with a black keycard - collect the keycard to open the door
Coins are scattered across the map. Five coins are needed for the user to access the main door
A hazardous door blocks the way to the exit - players need to find a red keycard to unlock it (without the keycard, players receive damage from the door)
Once a user has 5 coins, they will be able to exit the facility
To end the game, players must walk towards the exit on the fence - this will give players a message that they have completed the game


Bugs
Players are unable to die in game as there is no mechanic implemented that kills them (due to time constraints)
Doors are supposed to move when opened but players just walk into it (Tried fixing but I didn't have time to check if it worked)
The instruction text at the beginning doesn't show up
The walls are not solid and users can walk through them (box collider + rigidbody is applied)
On-screen inventory count is bugged (I don't know how to use Canvas)
